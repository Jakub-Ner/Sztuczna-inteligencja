## Minimax Algorithm for Halma
This project implements and analyzes various versions of the minimax algorithm for decision-making in the game of Chinese Checkers. The focus is on comparing the performance and effectiveness of different implementations.

### Implemented Versions:
**Recursive Minimax**: The basic recursive implementation of the minimax algorithm, which explores the game tree to find the optimal move.


**Concurrent Minimax**: A concurrent version of the minimax algorithm, leveraging goroutines for parallel exploration of the game tree.


**Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, an optimization technique that reduces the search space by eliminating branches that cannot lead to a better solution.
